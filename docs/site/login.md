## Logging into your Drupal site

When you first create a site on libops, logging into the admin account on the Drupal site can only be done by:

1. Using [sitectl to run drush uli](../development/cli.md#drush).
2. Accessing the login link [from your site dashboard](https://www.libops.io/user)

Both approaches generate a one-time login link for the super user account on your Drupal site. Keep the link safe and never share it with anyone you don't want to have full administrative access to your site.
